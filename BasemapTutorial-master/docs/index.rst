Basemap tutorial
================
Basemap is a great tool for creating maps using python in a simple way. It's a `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ extension, so it has got all its features to create data visualizations, and adds the geographical projections and some datasets to be able to plot coast lines, countries, and so on directly from the library.

Basemap has got `some documentation <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html>`_, but some things are a bit more difficult to find. I started this documentation to extend a little the original documentation and examples, but it grew a little, and now covers many of the basemap possibilities. 

I started writing Basemap examples for a talk given during the `2014 SIGTE <http://www.sigte.udg.edu/jornadassiglibre2014/>`_ meetings and I posted some examples in my blog (`geoexamples.com <http://geoexamples.com/tags/basemap/>`_). I would really appreciate some feedback if somebody finds an error, or thinks that some section should be added. You can leave a comment at the `blog post announcing this tutorial <http://geoexamples.blogspot.com/2014/11/basemap-tutorial.html>`_.

Installation
=============
The objective of this tutorial was to show how to use Basemap, since the installation part is very well documented at `the official docs <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html>`_. 

In my case, I used Basemap in several Linux configurations.

* Using Ubuntu I used the Synaptic to install the library and its dependencies.
* Using an older Suse I used the source code

There is a `blog post <http://peak5390.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/matplotlib-basemap-tutorial-installing-matplotlib-and-basemap/>`_ explaining all the options
